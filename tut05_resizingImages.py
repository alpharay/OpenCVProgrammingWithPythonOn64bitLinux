Purpose: Learn how to resize images from one format to another. We will use this file to perform the resizing action done with image magic as outlined in the 'NB:' section below

NB: You'll need to install the imagemagick software. You can verify if it is already installed on you machine by typing the command into your terminal <identify -version>
    Afterwards, the command(s):
               1.  <convert old_image.jpg new_image.png> for example, could be used to do a conversion of a 'jpg' image to a 'png' image
               2.  <convert old_image.jpg -resize 50% new_image.png>, could also be used to resize the image
